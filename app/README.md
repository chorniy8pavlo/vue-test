# Author words
Hi! Actually, I am not Vue.js developer, as I told you - I am React dev. But, anyway I've tried to do something using documentation, Google, and my JS skills.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```
